# eGO User Scripts
[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) plugins designed to improve the EdgeGamers Forums and MAUL website.

Use at your own risk.

## Install
Ensure that Tampermonkey is installed, then head to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/blankdvth/eGOScripts/releases/latest), and find the corresponding script under the "Assets" section. Click the script and Tampermonkey will open an install prompt. Follow these same steps to update whenever there's a new release.

## Descriptions
- [**EGO Ad Resize**](src/EGO%20Ad%20Resize.ts): Removes additional whitespace leftover from adblock removing ads on the forums
- [**EGO Forum Enhancement**](src/EGO%20Forum%20Enhancement.ts): Adds additional features and QOL changes to the eGO forums
- [**EGO MAUL Enhancement**](src/EGO%20MAUL%20Enhancement.ts): Adds additional features and QOL changes to MAUL
- [**GameME Space Render**](src/GameME%20Space%20Render.ts): Renders whitespace in GameME Chat History (and fixes console spam)

## Update Notice [2023-02-11]
The plugin was ported over to Typescript and a new release system on this date. Old scripts will no longer automatically update, and the script download page is now different (see [Install](#install)). When porting over to the new script(s), disable your pre-existing ones, then install the scripts via the new process. You can port over your settings by clicking on your old script(s) in the Tampermonkey dashboard, heading to the Storage tab (Advanced view needs to be enabled), and copying everything in there into the Storage tab on the new script. If this is too complicated for you, simply take a note of your existing settings and reapply them in the new script.
