# eGO User Scripts
[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) plugins designed to improve the EdgeGamers Forums and MAUL website.

Use at your own risk.

## Install
Ensure that Tampermonkey is installed, then head to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/blankdvth/eGOScripts/releases/latest), and find the corresponding script under the "Assets" section. Click the script and Tampermonkey will open an install prompt. Follow these same steps to update whenever there's a new release.
